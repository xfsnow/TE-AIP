# Task 03 - Deploy to Azure App Services (20 minutes)

## Introduction

Running the API and dashboard locally are a good proof of concept, but the Contoso Suites team makes heavy use of Azure Application Services and would like to ensure that what you build locally will integrate well into their workflow. The Contoso Suites team uses GitHub for source control and GitHub Actions workflows for code deployment, and would like to ensure that this solution will not be overly disruptive of their current CI/CD process.

## Description

In this task, you will deploy the Contoso Suites API and dashboard to Azure Application Services. The Contoso Suites development team has provided you with Dockerfiles to containerize each application, as well as GitHub Actions workflows you will be able to use in your own repository.

## Success Criteria

- You have deployed your API and dashboard as Azure Application Services and are able to access the dashboard remotely.

## Key Tasks

### 01: Manage GitHub Actions workflows

Navigate to the `.github/workflows/` folder and remove the `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` workflow. Then, rename `api.yml.txt` to `api.yml` and `dashboard.yml.txt` to `dashboard.yml`.

### 02: Track Azure resource keys and settings

In [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the resource group you have created and select the **Container registry** in the resource group. Navigate to the **Access keys** in the **Settings** menu and make note of your **Login server**, **Username**, and **password**. You will need these for GitHub Actions secrets. Also make note of the **Registry name** in order to modify the GitHub Actions workflows.

### 03: Create a service principal

Create a new service principal named `TechExcelAzurePaaS` using the following command in the az CLI, being sure to replace `{SUB_ID}` and `{RG}` with your subscription ID and resource group, respectively:

```cmd
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "TechExcelAzurePaaS" --json-auth --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{SUB_ID}/resourceGroups/{RG}
```
Retain the JSON output to use in a GitHub Actions secret.

**Note:** If you use a Microsoft internal subscription, the above command may fail due to security restrictions. You may manually create the service principal and assign role to your resource group.

1. Navigate to Entra ID in the Console

Left navigation: Manage > App registrations
In the main pane, click + New registration at top-left.

- Create a new secret and immediately copy its Value (only available once at creation). This value is used for `clientSecret` in the following JSON data. If lost, create a new secret.

Click Overview, in the Essentials section:
- Record the displayed IDs
- Use the JSON template below to combine with the copied client secret and Subscription ID (found in your resource group's Essentials section):

```json
{
  "clientId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc",
  "clientSecret": "dummySecret12345",
  "subscriptionId": "abcd1234-ab12-cd34-ef56-abcdef123456",
  "tenantId": "98765432-9876-9876-9876-987654321abc",

  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

2. Assign Roles

On the created resource group page:
Left navigation: Select **Access control**
Main pane:
- Click **+Add > Add role assignment**
On the Role page:
- Select **Privileged administrator roles**
- Choose **Contributor**
- Click **Next** at the bottom
On the Members page:
- Click **+ Select members** next to "Member"
- In the Select members panel:
  - Search for your service principal name: `TechExcelAzurePaaS-<YourAlias>`
  - Select your matching record from results
  - Click **Select**
Finalize with **Next** > **Review + Create** to complete setup.

### 04: Create GitHub Actions secrets

Create the following GitHub Actions secrets:

  1. `STREAMLIT_SECRETS` -- Paste in the entirety of your `secrets.toml` file. Be sure to change the value of `[api][endpoint]` from localhost to the URL of your API's App Service.
  2. `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER` -- Retrieve from your container registry's **Access keys** menu.
  3. `ACR_USERNAME` -- Retrieve from your container registry's **Access keys** menu.
  4. `ACR_PASSWORD` -- Retrieve from your container registry's **Access keys** menu.
  5. `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` -- Paste in the entirety of the JSON output from running `az ad sp create-for-rbac`.

Additionally, create the following GitHub Actions variable:

  1. `APP_PREFIX` -- Paste in the unique identifier you used for your Azure resources.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

1. To create a GitHub Actions secret, navigate to your forked GitHub repository and select the **Settings** menu. From there, navigate to **Secrets and variables** and select the **Actions** menu. You can then create new repository secrets.

    You will need to create a total of five such secrets:

    1. `STREAMLIT_SECRETS` -- Paste in the entirety of your `secrets.toml` file.
    2. `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER` -- Retrieve from your container registry's **Access keys** menu.
    3. `ACR_USERNAME` -- Retrieve from your container registry's **Access keys** menu.
    4. `ACR_PASSWORD` -- Retrieve from your container registry's **Access keys** menu.
    5. `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` -- Paste in the entirety of the JSON output from running `az ad sp create-for-rbac`.

2. To create a GitHub Actions variable,  switch from the **Secrets** tab to the **Variables** tab. You can then create new repository variables.

    ![Add a new GitHub Actions repository-level variable.](../../media/Solution/0103_Variables.png)

    You will need to create one variable:

    1. `APP_PREFIX` -- Paste in the unique identifier associated with your Azure resources. This is a 13-character string.

### 05: Deploy code changes

1. Commit and push your repository changes.
2. Manually execute the GitHub Actions workflows named **API Deployment** and **Dashboard Deployment** if they do not run automatically.

    <details markdown="block">

### 06: Test chat with data

Connect to your dashboard website and ensure that you can still perform chat with data operations. To test, you can use a question like, "Do I need to pay extra money to use an EV station when I am a guest of the hotel?"

{: .note }
> It may take several minutes for Azure Application Services to be ready to serve your dashboard website. If it does not come up within 5 minutes or so, you could choose to **Stop** and then **Start** the App Service.
